//Alogrithm for calculation of rate of gradual increase of the rpm
/*
let the circumference of the tyre of car be 1740mm (taken from internet)
and we have to reach an speed of 30km/h in 10 sec 
diatance travelled by car in 1 min when travelling at an speed of 30km/k=30/60=0.5km=500m
rpm of the car when it is travelling at an speed of 30km/h=(500*1000)/1740=287.3563rpm

so car must reach an rpm of 287.3563 in 10 sec second 
assuming acceration of car to be constant car rpm must increase at an constant rate of 28.73563 rpm
